#Auto-rotating On-call List Application

A Flask app that reads a JSON file with team-member info, and spits out an on-call list based on the week of the year.


The `logo.svg` and `yes.png`  are both public domain works. Feel free to replace those.

### Installation

Set up a Python3 virtualenv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
